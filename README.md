# Configuring WEP on a wireless router

WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy, a Wi-Fi wireless network security standard. 
A WEP key is a security passcode for Wi-Fi devices. 
WEP keys enable devices on a local network to exchange encrypted (mathematically encoded) messages with each other while hiding the contents of the messages from easy viewing by outsiders.
